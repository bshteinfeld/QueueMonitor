IT Helpdesk Queue Monitor
============

A standalone java application which connects to the IT helpdesk KACE server which contains all the user tickets.
Then queries the KACE database using JDBC with mySQL and analyzes the results to display different statistics about the current tickets in the helpdesk's queue. This application is displayed on a TV screen mounted on the wall near the physical helpdesk in an effort to increase its effieciency by indicating which type of tickets need the most urgent attention. Following a carfully chosen airport theme, this application shows the new starters as "arrivals",  terminations as "deptartures", tickets older than a day as "delays", and various statistics as "exchange rates".
